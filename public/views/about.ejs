            <p>The dream of WIKR began in 2012 when I (Joshua) was just eight years old. I received an electronics project kit that included a “build your own radio station” project.</p>

            <p>I built it, hooked the old family laptop to the input, and the dream was born. At the time, I used my initials as the callsign: KJNL.</p>

            <p>I wasn't impressed with the range, so I used my remaining Christmas money to buy an amplifier, which boosted the signal to about one mile.</p>

            <p>Fast forward a few years and I moved online as Mix-FM. It wasn't very successful, as I was still young and figuring things out.</p>

            <p>After moving to North Carolina, the station went through name changes, format changes, and long periods of downtime. Then in 2024, I came up with the call letters WIKR and have used them ever since.</p>

            <p>It still wasn't smooth sailing, though — we faced a hardware failure that took the station off the air for about a year and a half.</p>

            <p>Now, as of December 2025, WIKR finally has enough funding (supplied by my fast-food job) to stay on the air consistently.</p>

            <p>Our current plans are to become self-sufficient and save up for a proper FM license — though that will take quite some time.</p>
